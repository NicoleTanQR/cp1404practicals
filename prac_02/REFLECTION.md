# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

My understanding of "lecture videos": video recordings / self-managed component of lectures, not live seminars

Time: not scheduled; years of experimentation (e.g., timeblocking, personal spreadsheets) convinced me that scheduling
is not viable for me  
Location: home  
Duration: see "Time" (above); "breakdown of the video lectures for each week" alone does not warrant scheduling

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Articulating concerns in class

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Start relying more on other provided materials (e.g., "Style Guide" for "for i in range(n)")

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Time management while doing practicals

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Doing them earlier
