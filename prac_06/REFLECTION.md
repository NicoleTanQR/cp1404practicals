# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I do not allow myself to spend too long on docstrings in order to improve my
time management

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Improve my focus

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching all lecture videos

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Improve naming (e.g., for variables)

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

There should be a poll on whether the lecture videos should be broken down into
multiple videos or not, because I prefer it to be one long video for each week
