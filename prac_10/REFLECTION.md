# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Decent for small tasks, questionable for large tasks

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It seems to get worse

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

May need to break down larger tasks to get a better sense of their
complexity for better estimate accuracy

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Better understanding of testing for different contexts — so, to analyse
choices more critically

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

They help refine my understanding of various programming aspects as I
strive to provide accurate feedback

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review of armiahmeti's Prac 7](https://github.com/armiahmeti/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

My review is comprehensive, considering practical content (e.g., the
right logic for the context — "==" instead of ">="), coding conventions,
and the school's recommendations (e.g., "attrgetter" instead of
"lambda")

### Good Code Review 2

[Review of Dharshanaprasad's Prac 9](https://github.com/Dharshanaprasad/cp1401practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

My review is comprehensive, considering practical content (e.g.,
inheritance), coding conventions, and the school's recommendations
(e.g., consistency in detail level)

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Reduce unnecessary words so students can focus on tasks

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Clarifying doubts with tutor
